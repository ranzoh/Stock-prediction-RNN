# Stock-prediction-RNN

This is a deep learning method to predict stock market prices.
The idea is to collect historical dataset of stock close prices, and to use the close price of 19 consecutive days to predict the next day (the 20th day) using recurrent neural network (RNN).
I got pretty good results with Intel (INTC) stock -> MSE of 0.18.

The data consists of 9500 daily closing prices since March 1980.
